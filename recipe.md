RECIPE-

For making Bhature

Add maida in a bowl.
Add baking powder, salt, oil and mix well.
Add yogurt and knead to a smooth dough.
Cover it with muslin cloth and allow to rest for 3-4 hours.
After the completion of time, you will observe that the dough becomes even more softer, moist and slightly raised.
Once again knead the dough.
Now take a small portion of it and roll it in an oval shape.
Now deep fry and when it puffs up, turn it to other side.
There is a trick of easily making a puff of bhatura.
While frying these bhaturas, press the centre of the bhatura lightly with a frying spoon. This makes the bhatura easy puff up.
Deep fry till it turns to light brown color.
In the same way, make the remaining bhaturas.

For making Chole

Pressure cook the kabuli chana with bay leaf, cinnamon and tea bag, until they are soft.
Discard the tea bag, drain and keep aside.
Heat oil in a pan. Add the cumin seeds.
Now add the onion paste. After 2-3 minutes add the ginger-garlic paste.
Saute till the onion turns golden brown.
Then add the red chilli powder, dry mango powder, chole masala, turmeric powder, cumin seed powder, coriander powder and the salt.
Saute for sometime.
Now add the tomato paste, and saute till it comes to boil.
